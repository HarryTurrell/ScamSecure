Advance Fee Fraud
Advance Fee Fraud is when someone tricks you into paying upfront for goods, services, or rewards that never arrive. It covers a wide range of scams, but all have the same structure: the promise of something valuable, but only if you first send money. These frauds can include fake loans, false inheritances, bogus prize wins, or phantom property rentals. The fraudster might even pretend to help recover money you’ve already lost to another scam.
Example: You get an email saying you’ve inherited a fortune from a relative you’ve never heard of. However, to release the money, you must pay an administrative fee. Once paid, the fraudster disappears—and the inheritance never existed.

Authorised Push Payment (APP) Fraud
APP fraud happens when you're tricked into willingly sending money to a fraudster's bank account. This often involves someone impersonating a trusted authority, such as your bank or HMRC. The scammer may say your money is at risk and instruct you to move it to a "safe account", – which is, in fact, theirs. Once the money is gone, it's challenging to recover it.
Example: You receive a call from someone claiming to be from your bank, saying there has been suspicious activity on your account. They urge you to transfer your money to a secure account for safety. Later, you find out this so-called "secure" account belonged to a criminal.

Banking and Card Fraud – Cash Machines
This scam involves tampering with cash machines to steal your card details or PIN. Criminals may distract you while you're using an ATM, or use hidden devices, such as skimmers and cameras, to clone your card. If your card gets stuck, you might leave it behind, and the fraudster returns to retrieve it.
Example: A person nearby offers to help when the machine fails to read your card. They convince you to try your PIN again. Once you leave, they remove a fake panel, take your card, and use the PIN you typed in.

Computer Software Service Fraud
Scammers call pretending to be from tech companies like Microsoft or Amazon. They claim there's a virus or security issue on your computer and offer to fix it. You're asked to install remote access software, giving the criminal complete control. They may install malware or steal data, and often request a fee afterwards.
Example: You receive a call from someone claiming to be from your broadband provider. They inform you that your internet is compromised and guide you through the installation of software. They then copy your files and charge you £200 for "repairs."

Courier Fraud
Fraudsters pose as police officers or bank staff and claim there’s fraud on your account. They ask you to help with an investigation by withdrawing money or handing over your card. A courier is sent to collect it. Sometimes, they ask you to purchase high-value goods, such as watches, or withdraw foreign currency.
Example: You get a call from someone claiming to be a police detective investigating fraud. You're asked to withdraw £3,000 in cash and give it to a courier for analysis. They promise it will be returned, but it never is.

Door-to-Door Fraud
This scam involves someone knocking at your door offering repairs, goods, or services. The work may be overpriced, unnecessary, or never completed. Fraudsters often target vulnerable individuals, using intimidation or scare tactics to pressure them into making immediate payments.
Example: A man says he’s fixing a neighbour’s roof and noticed tiles missing from yours. He offers to fix it for £500 if you pay in cash today. After paying, he vanishes without doing any work.

Holiday Fraud
Holiday fraud happens when you pay for travel, accommodation, or event tickets that turn out to be fake or don’t exist. Criminals use convincing adverts and even send "confirmation" emails to make the booking look genuine. Victims often find out they’ve been scammed when they show up and find there’s no reservation.
Example: You book a luxury villa online at a discounted rate. When you arrive on holiday, there's no record of your booking, and someone else is staying there.

Identity Fraud
In identity fraud, criminals use your details to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or even commit crimes in your name. This information might be obtained from phishing emails, hacked accounts, or even discarded mail. The effects can be long-lasting and damaging to your credit rating.
Example: You start receiving letters about a credit card you never applied for. Checking your credit report reveals multiple accounts opened fraudulently in your name.

Investment Fraud
Investment fraud involves being persuaded to invest in schemes that are either fake or high-risk. The fraudster may offer huge returns on shares, cryptocurrency, land, or commodities. Victims may initially see small early profits to gain trust, only to lose larger amounts later.
Example: You're contacted by a company offering guaranteed profits from investing in fine wine. After sending £5,000, you're told to invest more for bigger gains. When you ask to withdraw, the company stops replying.

Online Shopping and Auction Site Fraud
Scammers sell goods online that don't exist or are fake. They often request payment by bank transfer instead of through secure platforms. Sometimes they pretend to be buyers and send fake payment confirmations. You might send an item before realising no money has been received.
Example: You buy a phone on an online marketplace. The seller offers a discount if you pay directly into their bank account. After transferring the money, they vanish and never send the phone.
________________________________________
Payment Fraud
Payment fraud mainly targets businesses, often through hacked or spoofed email accounts. Fraudsters impersonate senior staff or suppliers and ask accounts teams to update bank details or send payments to a new account.
Example: A finance officer receives an email that appears to be from the CEO, requesting an urgent transfer to a new supplier. The money is sent, but the email was fake, and the funds are lost.

Recruitment Fraud
This scam targets job seekers with fake job offers. Victims are asked to pay for training, DBS checks, or travel upfront. Sometimes the job never existed, and sometimes criminals steal your personal information for identity fraud.
Example: You're told you've got a remote job but must pay £75 for background checks. After paying, the recruiter disappears, and the company can't be contacted.

Romance and Dating Fraud
Criminals create fake profiles on dating apps or websites. They build a relationship, earn your trust, and then ask for money, often claiming they're stuck abroad or need help with a personal crisis. Victims are emotionally manipulated and sometimes repeatedly defrauded.
Example: You meet someone online who says they love you within days. They soon claim their child is sick and ask for money for hospital bills. You send the money, but they keep inventing more crises.
________________________________________
Scam Mail
Scam mail arrives through your letterbox promising prizes or special offers in return for an upfront payment. These letters are often personalised to make you feel chosen. Once you respond, you're likely to be added to a list and targeted again.
Example: You receive a letter stating that you've won a prize draw, but you must send £20 to claim it. You never receive the prize, and more letters arrive asking for more money.
________________________________________
Ticketing Fraud
Ticketing fraud happens when fake or non-existent tickets are sold for concerts, sports events, or travel. Scammers often operate on resale websites or social media. Victims only find out they've been scammed when they are denied entry or never receive their tickets.
Example: You buy tickets to a football match from an online seller. On the day, the barcode doesn't work at the gate, and you're turned away. The seller has disappeared.
